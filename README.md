JSONClasses is a data flow pipeline and data graph framework written in Python.
It supports data sanitization, data validation, data transformation, data
presentation, data serialization, data graphing and data querying. It
eliminates the redundant coding of the process by an intuitive and innovative
declarative manner.

## How JSONClasses Works?

JSONClasses uses several Python features like type hinting and dataclasses.
With the great metaprogramming functionalities that Python offers, we can
easily extend it into a great DSL for declaring data structures, transforming
rules and validation rules.

## Why Not Create Another DSL?

GraphQL's Schema Definition Language cannot work well with programming
languages' syntax checking and type completion. To support more and more
functions, a DSL would become more and more like a programming language.

This is similar React.js, Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI. The structures of the
declaration is embedded in code, not in a special text file.

## Why Python Is Chosen?

Python is the programming language which is nearest to AI areas. The era we are
living is an era and a generation empowered by AI. AI algorithms empower
products with unimaginable stunning features. A great product should adapt to
some level of AI to continue providing great functions for it's targeting
audience.

## Business Logic Examples

### Example 1: Dating App Users

Let's say, you are building the base user functionality for a cross-platform
dating app.

The product requirements are:

1. Unique phone number is required
2. Password should be secure, encrypted, hidden from response
3. Gender cannot be changed after set
4. This product is adult only
5. User intro should be brief

Let's transform the requirements into code.

```python
from jsonclasses import jsonclass, types
from jsonclasses_pymongo import pymongo
from jsonclasses_server import api


@api
@pymongo
@jsonclass
class User:
    id: str = types.readonly.str.primary.mongoid.required
    phone_no: str = types.str.unique.index.match(local_phone_no_regex).required #1
    email: str = types.str.match(email_regex)
    password: str = types.str.writeonly.length(8, 16).match(secure_password_regex).transform(salt).required #2
    nickname: str = types.str.required
    gender: str = types.str.writeonce.oneof(['male', 'female']) #3
    age: int = types.int.min(18).max(100) #4
    intro: str = types.str.truncate(500) #5
    created_at: datetime = types.readonly.datetime.tscreated.required
    updated_at: datetime = types.readonly.datetime.tsupdated.required
```
